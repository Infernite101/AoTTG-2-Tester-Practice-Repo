# AoTTG-2-Tester-Practice-Repo

This repo is meant as a sandbox for AoTTG 2 testers to toy with.  Nothing here is actually important, so feel free to experiment with it--even if you accidentally break something, it won't cause problems.

Testers should get used to using Issues in this repo.  This video is a good overview of how they work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJlYiMp8FuY

After you've watched that video, click on the Issues tab up above (Just under "SlowDeepExhalation", to the right of "<> Code"), and then click on Labels, and find "Good Bug Report!" in the list.  Click on it, and it'll show you a list of fake bug reports written by other testers, following the basic format for what a bug report should look like.  Currently, they should all follow this format:

**Bug:** What the bug is.

**How to Reproduce:** How you can make the bug happen.

**Expected Behavior:** What *should* happen instead of the bug.

**Additional Notes:** Anything else that should be mentioned about the bug.

Read one or a few of them, and then click the green "New Issue" in the upper right, and write up a bug report yourself, following the same format.  The bug doesn't have to actually exist, or be in AoTTG--you can describe a bug that exists in *any* game, or make something up about purple unicorns, as long as it's clear, understandable, and follows the correct format.  Finally, make sure you mark the issue with a bug label!

Once you're done, tell Antigasp (SlowDeepExhalation) that you created the bug, and he'll tell you if it should be changed or improved.  If not, he'll give it the "Good Bug Report!" label, and you can pat yourself on the back.
